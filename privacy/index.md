			<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-500">We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you'll always be able to opt out. If you give us personal information, we won't do anything evil with it. We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store these.</p>
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-500">That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details before you use any of our sites.</p>

("Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span>") makes available services include our web sites (www.{{ site.enforce_ssl }} and www.grovedesigns.co), our blog, our API, and any other software, sites, and services offered by Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> in connection to any of those (taken together, the "Service").

			<h3 class="mb-6 text-xl font-semibold font-heading mt-6">Visitors</h3>
			
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-500">Like most website operators, Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> visitors use its website. From time to time, Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-500">Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.</p>

	
			<h3 class="mb-6 text-xl font-semibold font-heading mt-6">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
			
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-500">Certain visitors to Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> websites choose to interact with Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> in ways that require Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span>. Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.</p>
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-500">Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.</p>

	
			<h3 class="mb-6 text-xl font-semibold font-heading mt-6">Aggregated Statistics</h3>
			
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-500">Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Service. For instance, Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> may monitor the most popular parts of the site. Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

	
			<h3 class="mb-6 text-xl font-semibold font-heading mt-6">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
			
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-500">Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> behalf or to provide services available at Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span>, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

	
			<h3 class="mb-6 text-xl font-semibold font-heading mt-6">Cookies</h3>
			
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-500">A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the Service each time the visitor returns. Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> uses cookies to help Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> identify and track visitors, their usage of Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> Service, and their Service access preferences. Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> websites, with the drawback that certain features of Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

	
			<h3 class="mb-6 text-xl font-semibold font-heading mt-6">Data Storage</h3>
			
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-500">Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.</p>

	
			<h3 class="mb-6 text-xl font-semibold font-heading mt-6">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
			
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-500">Although most changes are likely to be minor, Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> sole discretion. Grove Technologies<span class="servicemark"><sup>&#x00AE;</sup></span> encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
